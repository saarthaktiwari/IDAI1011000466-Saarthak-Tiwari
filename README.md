**Project Overview:**

My NutriWell chatbot allows users to enter details such as physical measurements, their age and name in order to create a personalized experience. It asks for the users fitness goals and information about gym visits. It displays an array of options that the user can pick from that detail all of the possible actions that the bot can perform, including but not limited to, motivational quotes, snack recommendations, water intake chart, educational content about macronutrients and supplements, and more. The bot aims to act as a personal companion for each user, remembering their personal details to make it a customizable and immersive experience while not only providing information they need but also motivating and adding a layer of friendliness, helping them reach their goals. The usage of suggestion chips and informational images add to the quality of the experience.

**Intents:**

* Introduction and Greeting intents begin the user's journey

* Name and Age, Allergy and Measurements intent take important physical information about the user

* Measurements Change intent allow users to update their measurements

* User is then asked if they would like to see a list of options

* If no, it waits in case the user changes their mind

* If yes, Display option shows the options via chips

* Options include: Water intake, Calories, Macronutrients, Snacks, Supplements, Motivation

* Display again allows the user to ask to see the list again after completing an option

* Water intake and Calories intents display charts for the user to match their info with and see the required intake of both

* Macronutrients and Supplements give a list of either such as Protein, Carbs, Fat, Testosterone boosters, Creatine, Vitamins and more for the user to learn more about

* Snacks intent gives a randomized snack option for the user to try that acts as a healthy alternative while retaining the flavor and taste

* Motivation intent gives a randomized motivational quote for the user to feel inspired

* Thank you and Goodbye intents allow the user to thank the chatbot at any time, and exit the conversation at any time.

**The Chatbot was integrated via Dialogflow Messenger itself, which was also utilized during testing within the Dialogflow website.**

**This document contains a direct link to a Messenger site where both the text and rich content can be displayed to the user, immediately ready for testing.**
